# A Beginner's Guide to Online Multiplayer

This repo contains the starter kit & materials for my [GlitchCon 2017](http://www.glitchcon.mn/) workshop on multiplayer games.  

See the [master](https://github.com/OmarShehata/glitchmultiplayer) branch for tutorial steps. 

This branch is an example of implementing the **Bonus: Interpolate Positions** step. It builds off [step2](https://github.com/OmarShehata/glitchmultiplayer/tree/step2) to interpolate the positions on the client side so it looks visually smoother even with lag.
