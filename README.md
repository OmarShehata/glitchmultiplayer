# A Beginner's Guide to Online Multiplayer

This repo contains the starter kit & materials for my [GlitchCon 2017](http://www.glitchcon.mn/) workshop on multiplayer games.  

See the [master](https://github.com/OmarShehata/glitchmultiplayer) branch for tutorial steps. 

This branch has everything up to **Step 3** completed. It implements bullets simulated by the server and synced across clients.
